## Number 11.4:
Fit and report the logistic regression of Sex on the six predictors. Give an interpretation of the estimated coefficient for Ht18.
```{r}
#View(BGSall)
data(BGSall)
logim <- glm(Sex ~ HT2 + HT9 + HT18 + WT2 + WT9 + WT18,
             family = binomial(link = "logit"), BGSall)
summary(logim)
```
Interpretation of Ht18: Holding all else constant, if Ht18 increases by one unit, then the odds of success decreases by a factor of e^(-1.42114). This is true because the Beta for Ht18 is negative and equal to the exponent of e.
